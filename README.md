# Book Site

Hi everyone! 
This is one of my HMTL and CSS projects. It will be a website for a fictional bookstore.
It's goning to have a hamburguer menu, links to other pages, examples of different kinds of books, ect.
The idea of this project is to show what I can do using HTML and CSS, and practice de responsiveness of the website for different types of devices.

This project was made in the Alura HTML and CSS: Responsiveness with Mobile-First course.
